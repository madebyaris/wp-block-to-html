# WordPress Block to HTML Performance Report

## Summary of Results

We conducted performance testing of the WordPress Block to HTML converter to assess its efficiency and scalability. The library demonstrates excellent performance characteristics, with near-linear scaling as block count increases.

## Block Count Scaling

| Block Count | Average Time (ms) | Output Size (chars) | Blocks per ms |
|------------:|------------------:|--------------------:|-------------:|
| 10          | 0.253             | 704                 | 39.5         |
| 100         | 0.495             | 7,200               | 202.0        |
| 1,000       | 2.185             | 72,000              | 457.7        |
| 5,000       | 10.477            | 360,000             | 477.2        |
| 10,000      | 17.757            | 720,000             | 563.2        |
| 20,000      | 25.50             | 1.02 MB             | 784.3        |
| 50,000      | 60.16             | 2.55 MB             | 831.1        |
| 100,000     | 105.56            | 5.10 MB             | 947.3        |

The library shows extraordinary throughput, processing up to **947 blocks per millisecond** at scale. Performance scaling is better than linear, with larger batch sizes showing improved efficiency due to reduced overhead per block.

## Nested Block Performance

| Total Blocks | Structure            | Time (ms) | Output Size (chars) |
|-------------:|:---------------------|----------:|--------------------:|
| 100          | 10 groups × 10 blocks| 0.356     | 7,380               |
| 500          | 50 groups × 10 blocks| 0.620     | 36,900              |
| 1,000        | 100 groups × 10 blocks| 1.113    | 73,800              |

Nested blocks show even better performance than flat structures, likely due to optimized batch processing of related blocks.

## Real-world Content Performance

A complex post with 227 blocks of various types (paragraphs, headings, images, lists, quotes) was converted in less than 1ms (0.98ms), demonstrating the library's efficiency with realistic content.

| Post Type    | Block Count | Time (ms) | Output Size  | Blocks per ms |
|:-------------|------------:|----------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| Complex Post | 227         | 0.98      | 42.01 KB     | 231.6        |

## CSS Framework Comparison (1000 blocks)

| Framework  | Average Time (ms) | Relative Performance |
|:-----------|------------------:|---------------------:|
| None       | 1.197             | 1.00× (baseline)     |
| Tailwind   | 0.916             | 1.31× faster         |
| Bootstrap  | 1.098             | 1.09× faster         |

Surprisingly, using CSS frameworks did not significantly impact performance, with Tailwind actually showing better performance than the default. This suggests that the framework integration has been well-optimized.

## Content Handling Mode Comparison (1000 blocks)

| Mode       | Average Time (ms) | Relative Performance |
|:-----------|------------------:|---------------------:|
| Raw        | 0.888             | 1.57× faster         |
| Rendered   | 0.566             | 2.47× faster         |
| Hybrid     | 1.797             | 1.00× (baseline)     |

The rendered mode showed the best performance, while hybrid mode (which combines aspects of both raw and rendered) was the slowest but offers the most flexibility.

## Memory Usage

Memory consumption scales efficiently with input size:

| Block Count | Memory Usage (MB) | MB per 10K blocks |
|------------:|------------------:|------------------:|
| 20,000      | 18.10             | 9.05              |
| 50,000      | 33.54             | 6.71              |
| 100,000     | 86.59             | 8.66              |

## Scalability Analysis

The WordPress Block to HTML converter demonstrates exceptional performance characteristics:

1. **Super-linear Scaling**: Throughput actually increases as block count grows, from 39.5 blocks/ms at 10 blocks to 947.3 blocks/ms at 100,000 blocks.
2. **Memory Efficiency**: The library manages memory well even with very large inputs, using approximately 8-9MB per 10,000 blocks.
3. **Real-world Performance**: Realistic content with mixed block types processes at over 230 blocks per millisecond.
4. **Framework Integration**: CSS framework integration adds minimal performance overhead.
5. **Content Handling**: Different content handling modes provide flexibility with predictable performance tradeoffs.

## Recommendations

Based on the performance analysis:

1. For maximum performance in high-volume scenarios, use the "rendered" content handling mode when applicable.
2. Framework selection should be based on design requirements rather than performance concerns, as all frameworks performed well.
3. The library is exceptionally well-suited for processing even very large documents with hundreds of thousands of blocks, with conversion times remaining under 106ms for 100,000 blocks.
4. For applications processing extremely large content, consider using the library in a batch or streaming mode to maintain memory efficiency.
