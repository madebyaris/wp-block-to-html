6. Document uncertainty and provide multiple platform specifications
7. Create fallback responsive strategy with progressive enhancement
8. Implement comprehensive testing strategy for validation
```

### Advanced Responsive Strategy Conflicts
```markdown
‚ùå IF MULTIPLE PLATFORMS DETECTED OR CONFLICTS ARISE:
1. Prioritize by primary target platform (user specification or usage data)
2. Create comprehensive hybrid responsive strategy
3. Document platform-specific variants with detailed specifications
4. Ensure cross-platform compatibility with shared design system
5. Test on all detected platforms with real devices
6. Implement progressive enhancement for broader compatibility
7. Create platform-specific optimization strategies
8. Document performance implications and trade-offs
```

### Performance and Accessibility Validation Failures
```markdown
‚ùå IF PERFORMANCE OR ACCESSIBILITY TARGETS NOT MET:
1. Analyze performance bottlenecks with platform-specific tools
2. Implement optimization strategies (lazy loading, code splitting, caching)
3. Conduct comprehensive accessibility audit with assistive technology
4. Remediate accessibility issues with platform-specific solutions
5. Re-test with real devices and users
6. Document optimization strategies and accessibility implementations
7. Create monitoring and maintenance strategies
8. Establish continuous validation processes
